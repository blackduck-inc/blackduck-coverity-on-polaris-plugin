The Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin enables you to invoke Synopsys Polaris analysis from your Jenkins builds. Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins can be used in both freestyle and pipeline jobs. When the Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin runs, it checks the configured Synopsys Polaris server and the Jenkins node to see if the correct version of the Synopsys Polaris Command Line Interpreter (CLI) is already installed on the node. If not, the plugin installs the Synopsys Polaris CLI.
