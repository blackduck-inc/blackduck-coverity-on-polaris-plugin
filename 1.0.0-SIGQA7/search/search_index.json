The Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin enables you to invoke Synopsys Polaris analysis from your Jenkins builds. You can use Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins in both freestyle and pipeline jobs. When the Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin runs, it checks the configured Synopsys Polaris server and the Jenkins node to see if the correct version of the Synopsys Polaris Command Line Interpreter (CLI) is already installed on the node. If it is not installed, the plugin installs the Synopsys Polaris CLI. In either case, Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins then executes the Synopsys Polaris CLI, which analyzes your project, and uploads results to Synopsys Polaris.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"10-introduction/#introduction","text":"Synopsys Polaris helps security and development teams analyze security risks in their software products.
