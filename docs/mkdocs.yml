# Gradle task "docs" does the following:
# 1. Converts freemarker templates in docs/templates to markdown in docs/generated using freemarker.
# 2. Converts markdown to a website in docs/site using mkdocs.
#
# Neither the 'generated' folder nor the mkdocs 'site' folder should be added to source control.
# After running the 'docs' task, the 'site' folder can be uploaded to gh-pages.
# To build, install pip and python, then execute:
#   pip install mkdocs
#   pip install mkdocs-material
# To view the docs, you must execute:
#   At project root: ./gradlew docs
#   At docs: mkdocs serve --no-livereload
