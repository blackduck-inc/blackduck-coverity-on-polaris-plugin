# Configuring

Once the ${solution_name} plugin is installed, and before you use it in a job, you must configure the following:

1. ${polaris_cli_name}
1. ${solution_name}

## Configuring ${polaris_cli_name}

Use the following process to configure ${polaris_cli_name}:

1. In Jenkins, navigate to *Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration*.
1. Scroll down to the *${cli_config_header}* section, click *${add_polaris_cli_button}*, and complete the following:
    1. *Name*: A name for the ${polaris_cli_name} installation.
    1. *Install automatically*: To enable ${solution_name} to install the ${polaris_cli_name} from your ${polaris_product_name} server automatically, leave this box checked,
and proceed to the next step. To point ${solution_name} to an existing ${polaris_cli_name} installation, uncheck this box
and enter the path to the ${polaris_cli_name} directory in the *Installation directory* field.
1. Click *Save*.

## Configuring ${solution_name}

    1. *Advanced*: If you want to change the timeout that ${solution_name} uses while waiting
for a response from the ${polaris_product_name} server, click *Advanced*
and enter the timeout in seconds in the *Polaris connection timeout* field.
    1. *Test connection to Polaris*: To test that ${solution_name} can connect to ${polaris_product_name}
with the configuration data you have entered, click *Test connection to Polaris*.
