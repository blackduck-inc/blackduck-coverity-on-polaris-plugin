The Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin enables you to invoke Synopsys Polaris analysis from your Jenkins builds. You can use Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins in both freestyle and pipeline jobs. When the Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin runs, it checks the configured Synopsys Polaris server and the Jenkins node to see if the correct version of the Synopsys Polaris Command Line Interpreter (CLI) is installed on the node. If the Synopsys Polaris CLI is not installed, the plugin installs the CLI.

Refer to the Polaris Command Line Reference for information about the Polaris CLI. Freestyle job To use Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins in a freestyle job, add it as a build step at the point where you want to build your project, and complete the following: Polaris CLI Installation : Select the name that you assigned to your Synopsys Polaris CLI installation on the Manage Jenkins Global Tool Configuration page. Polaris Arguments : The arguments that you want passed to the Synopsys Polaris CLI, for example, analyze . Wait for Issues : If you want the build to wait until Synopsys Polaris determines whether there are issues with your project, check this box and use the If there are issues field to select the action you want the plugin to take when issues are discovered. Click Advanced... if you want to adjust maximum length of time the job will wait for issues ( Job timeout in minutes ). If you want the build to proceed without waiting, leave the Wait for Issues box unchecked. Click Save . Pipeline job The Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins plugin provides two pipeline steps: polaris : Runs the Synopsys Polaris CLI to initiate Synopsys Polaris analysis of your project. polarisIssueCheck : Waits until Synopsys Polaris has completed analysis of your project, and determines the number of issues found. Note that for polarisIssueCheck, the timeout in minutes field requires a positive integer. Non-integer values may be truncated by Jenkins before being passed on to the plugin. Documentation on using these pipeline steps can be found in the Jenkins pipeline steps documentation . Escaping arguments Whether using Synopsys Polaris for Jenkins in a freestyle or pipeline job, Synopsys Polaris CLI arguments must adhere to specific guidelines: All arguments must be separated by whitespace (specifically: spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns, or linefeeds). All values containing whitespace must be surrounded by quotation marks. You must escape all quotation marks (\", ') that are used in values. You must escape all backslashes (\\) that are used in values.
